    Transforming activities are human activities that transform inputs, so that the
    output of the activity is different from the inputs, e.g. a hard coal mine that
    transforms hard coal in ground to the marketable product hard coal. Transforming
    activities are here understood in the widest possible sense, including extraction,
    production, transport, consumption and waste treatment activities, i.e. any human
    activity where the intermediate output is different from the intermediate input.
    The concept “transforming activities” is introduced here simply to distinguish –
    in the further modelling and linking of activities – these “ordinary” activities
    from the market activities, production and supply mixes, import and export
    activities, and correction datasets. 1 = market activity. Market activities do not
    transform their inputs, but simply transfer the intermediate output from a
    transforming activity to the transforming activities that consume this intermediate
    output as an input, e.g. from hard coal at the supplier to hard coal at the
    consumer. Market activities typically mix similar intermediate outputs from
    different transforming activities. Market activities therefore supply consumption
    mixes of the intermediate outputs. 10 = market group. Market groups are to markets
    what markets are to transforming activities. In the undefined system model a market
    group only contains a reference product. The linking algorithm will add supplying
    markets as inputs which are contained in the location of the market group and have
    the same reference product. 2 = IO activity. An IO activity represents an activity
    dataset from a national supply-use table, i.e. typically the supply and use of one
    specific industry. 3 = Residual activity. A residual activity is the resulting
    activity when subtracting all available unit processes within an activity class from
    the supply-use data (IO activity) of the same activity class, for the same year and
    geo-graphical area. 4 = production mix. A production mix represents the
    production-volume-weighted average of the suppliers of a specific product within a
    geographical area.5 = import activity. An import activity represents the import of a
    specified product to a specified geographical area, solely for use in national
    balancing (not contributing to any auto-generated consumption mixes). Imports to
    administratively constrained markets and from partly isolated markets are modelled
    as ordinary transforming activities in order to be included in the relevant market
    activities (consumption mixes).6 = supply mix. A supply mix is a production mix with
    the addition of the import of a specified product to a specified geographical area.
    7 = export activity. An export activity represents the export volume of a national
    production mix that has the national area as its geographical location and does not
    contribute to any auto-generated consumption mixes. To give the correct value of the
    export, the same activities and data that are included with the market activities
    are added directly to the export activity. This includes transport activities,
    production losses, wholesaler and retailer activities, and product taxes and
    subsidies. 8 = re-export activity. A re-export activity represents the re-export
    volume of a geographical area and does not contribute to any auto-generated
    consumption mixes. 9 = correction activity. A correction activity is an activity
    that is added twice to a product system, one with a positive and once with a
    negative flow, in order to move one or more exchanges from one part of the system
    to another, e.g. to correct for downstream effects of an upstream activity, or to
    correct a bias in the mass-balance introduced by an allocation. More details on
    this is provided in the Chapters on "Downstream changes caused by differences in
